I used the following technolgy in java:

1-JavaLite --> I used it to handle the HTTP client

2-Java Spark --> to build the web service 

3- Vue.js -- > to handle the front end and rendering the data with html

I tried to create the web service and to handle the json response in very simple way,
even the html design didn't put any effort.
and i have tried to use w new technologies
